Most information about MDC was gathered from browsing the <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory">Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory GPL Source Release</a> and a document created by Wolfgang Prinz called <a href="https://gamespy-archives.quaddicted.com/sites/www.planetwolfenstein.com/themdcfile/MDC_File_Format.pdf">The MDC File Format</a>.</p>
<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>The MDC file format is a 3D model format used in games such as Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and is a successor format of the MD3 file format. It differs from MD3 in that it uses more advanced compression methods on the vertex coordinates and normals.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Compression:</h2>
<p>Vertex coordinates are compressed by dividing frame space into compressed frames and base frames. The base frames still work the same as in MD3, that means absolute vertex coordinates are stored as three short values. Compressed frames on the other hand store just relative values. The values are relative to its baseframe and take up three byte values. This can effectively half an MDC models file size compared to the same data stored in MD3. Compression can only be effective if the animated models vertexes generally do move across small distances per frame.</p>
<p>The vertex normals are also compressed. The uncompressed normals are stored in a short value. This value consists of a latitude and a longitude value. Together they represent the vertex normal in spherical coordinates. The compressed vertex normals work a bit different. They are precalculated a certain way. No longitude or latitude values are stored. Instead a byte is used to point to an array of 256 precalculated normals. The 256 normals are evenly (more or less) distributed across 3D space, but still fairly precise, considering it is only 256 values stored by a byte.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Tags:&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Tags are volumeless vectors. Tags are primarily used in aligning separate MD3 objects in-game. For example, the Tag object in the railgun model is called 'tag_weapon', and the position (and rotation) of this Tag gets aligned with those of the Tag named 'tag_weapon' in the player model, dragging the rest of the railgun model over with the [railgun's] Tag object. The railgun model follows its Tag positions and rotations, which in turn follows the positions and rotations of the player model Tag object (most noticeable in taunt animation). Tags are also used to line up the torso with the legs, and the head with the torso, and so on.</p>

<h2>Encoding:&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The encoded normal vector uses a spherical coordinate system. Since the normal vector is, by definition, a length of one, only the angles need to be recorded. Each angle is constrained within [0, 255], so as to fit in one octet. A normal vector encodes into 16 bits. (XXX: more blah)</p>

<h2>Encoding:</h2>
<p>To understand encoding imagine earth sliced up into 16 pieces along certain latitude values. On each latitude, the format now defines a certain number of evenly distributed longitudes. Near the poles, those longitude values are 4, near the equator, those longitude values are 32. The reason why there are just 4 longitudes on the poles is that near the poles, all normals are still pointing mostly south or north, so one does not need much detail in encoding and can devote finer detail to the longitudes on the equator.</p>
<p>From this base thought an array of 256 normals is created. A bit more than the first half indices of this array is devoted to the latitudes ranging from [90, 180] degrees. The rest of the array devotes to (90, 0], in that order.</p>
<p>Details can be gained by browsing Wolfgang Prinz, <a href="https://gamespy-archives.quaddicted.com/sites/www.planetwolfenstein.com/themdcfile/MDC_File_Format.pdf">The MDC File Format</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Decoding:</h2>
<p>Decoding now simply is taking the last byte of the ofsVec and indexing it into the array of 256 normals.</p>
